% Define your experimental data
% For example, let's say you have temperature readings as x and corresponding heat transfer readings as y
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
y = [22.4, 24.7, 27.1, 32.1, 35.6];

% Choose the degree of the polynomial for fitting
degree = 2; % You can adjust this depending on your data and desired fit

% Perform polynomial curve fitting
coefficients = polyfit(x, y, degree);

% Generate a higher resolution x for plotting the fitted curve
x_fit = linspace(min(x), max(x), 100);

% Evaluate the fitted polynomial at x_fit
y_fit = polyval(coefficients, x_fit);

% Plot the original data and the fitted curve
figure;
plot(x, y, 'o', x_fit, y_fit, '-');
xlabel('Temperature');
ylabel('Heat Transfer');
